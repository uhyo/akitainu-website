        <b>Akitainu</b> is a tool for unifying linting workflows of node.js
        projects. Based on <code>.akitainurc.js</code>, Akitainu can invoke
        multiple linters and provide results in a unified format. It also
        supports posting list results as a pull request review comment on
        GitHub.
      </p>
      <p>
        Akitainu is also suitable in the case where you want to tighten linter
        settings but cannot afford to fix all existing code for the new
        settings. Akitainu provides a pull request-based gradual adoption
        strategy in which only changed files are checked with the tightened
        setting. This way, existing code is gradually fixed as it is modified.
